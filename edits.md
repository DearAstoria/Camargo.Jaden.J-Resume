I notice when you put it in pdf it takes up two pages. I thought the resume was supposed to take up one page.

You wrote
"Currently working with a team of annotators, head by our product manager, and
mentored by the developers to detail 3D cloud points in preparation for our client's
Machine Learning algorithmn.
Gaining valuable real life insight into Software Engineering life cycles."
Think space and time efficiency. You do not need to restate that you are currently working when it is included in the dates. (May 2021-Present)
You do not need full sentences. If you were the employer making a decision to hire someone based on a resume, which words or phrases would you use to make your decision? Keep those, and get rid of the rest.

Also, "Co-managing busy casual restaurant in San Clemente, ensuring food and beverages go out accurately and timely, while managing staff and daily tasks. Restaurant revenue increased for the 4 consecutive years that I served here. Under my leadership staff were excited to serve and do their work with diligence, respect, and smiles. Propping up new leaders and building them up in their role was one of my key strengths.
Mitigating problems as they arose was something that came naturally to me"
Example of what I am talking about: Is your future employer going to care whether you can ensure food and beverages go out in an accurate and timely manner?
